                    <p>
                      Although just about 316 sq.kilometers in size, Malta has
                      had quite a tumultuous and action packed with history.
                      Several nations and kings fought wars and tried to control
                      it before being overthrown by the next who ruled it for a
                      period of time. Right from when the stone age man arrived
                      here with the British who ruled the islands for 150 years
                      from 1814 to 1964.
                      <br />
                      Although Malta has a rich history that dates back to
                      prehistory, it has a modern outlook and has stepped up to
                      the times and kept pace with the world, not just in terms
                      of overall outlook but also in terms of being hospitable
                      to foreign students arriving in Malta for further studies.
                      One of the unique features for students desirous of
                      furthering their studies is that they can study in Malta
                      without ielts if they can provide sufficient proof of
                      their English language ability of at least being at an
                      intermediate level.
                      <br />
                      As any of the study in Malta consultants can vouch,
                      students who opt for Malta for their further studies are
                      guaranteed to not just have a great time on off days
                      relaxing on the many beaches, but also when they are busy
                      studying. This is mainly because of the unique Problem
                      Based Learning or the PBL system that encourages students
                      to solve problems based on a practical approach as well as
                      self analysis that is combined with self study and self
                      discipline.
                      <br />
                      Thus, students who choose to study abroad in Malta are
                      guaranteed of quality education through self awareness,
                      combined with world recognition.

                      WHY STUDY IN MALTA FROM NEPAL ?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      One of the reasons why students get attracted to this tiny
                      nation for purposes of education is that it has a
                      uniqueness that is typical of many an islands. This is
                      combined with unique features that are listed below that
                      lend the islands a unique flavor when seen in light of
                      further education.The following are some of the unique
                      features that seem to attract Nepalese (Nepali) students
                      from Nepal when they think of quality education.
                    </p>
                    <ul className="wp-block-list">
                      <li>
                        More than 200 courses are offered in Malta. These are
                        adapted to assimilate international students and are
                        taught in English.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        One of the most unique features when students opt to
                        study in Malta is that there are courses in agriculture,
                        forestry and fishery, education and teaching and tourism
                        and leisure, Social and behavioral sciences, Transport
                        and logistics which are offered by a few universities
                        across the world.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        On an average the living expenses of a student range
                        from 300 to 600 euros a month. This is very less
                        compared to other centers of education.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Typical of an island nation, Malta offers not just sun
                        and surf, but also a host of unique features in the
                        realm of education as well as an open arms policy to
                        students as well as visiting dignitaries including guest
                        lecturers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Malta believes that it is never too young nor too old to
                        travel or at least come to Malta. That is the reason why
                        Study Abroad in Malta can be seen as not just something
                        academic but practical. This is because Malta welcomes 8
                        year olds to summer camps on the islands as well as 80
                        year olds.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Maltese have retained their expertise in the English
                        language long after the British granted them
                        independence 50 years ago.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A unique feature that comes to the fore is the
                        acceptance of a third country language as a language
                        that is taught, which will make the inhabitants of that
                        country feel comfortable in Malta. This is evident in
                        the acceptance of Mandarin Chinese that can answer
                        apprehensions about Why to Choose Malta for Higher
                        Study.
