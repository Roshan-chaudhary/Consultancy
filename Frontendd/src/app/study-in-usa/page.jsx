                                      terms of choice of courses within a
                                      college or university. During the course
                                      of study, a student can transfer from one
                                      course/stream to another or one
                                      institution to another. This aspect of the

                                      from other countries.

                                      social sciences. Strictly liberal arts
                                      colleges are often quite old and mostly
                                      private schools. They are highly-rated
                                      institutions as they stress on small
                                      classes, individual attention to the
                                      students, and closer relationships between
                                      the faculties and students. Many of them
                                      also generally have rigid admission
                                      standards. Among these schools are:

                                      institution where you intend to study, all
                                      academic records (SLC, +2 certificate,
                                      etc.), and any evidence if financial
                                      resources to show that you can afford your
                                      education. While there are no specific
                                      financial documents required, you should

                                      would support your case. Consular officers
                                      prefer to see at least six months
                                      transaction history from your bank
                                      accounts. A police certificate is not
                                      necessary for student visa applicants. All
                                      documents submitted should be genuine – if
                                      the consular officer at any time believes
                                      you have submitted a false document, you
                                      will be refused the visa and the
                                      document(s) could be turned over to the
                                      police.

                                      Each applicant’s case is different, but
                                      generally consular officers encourage you
                                      to wait until your circumstances have
                                      change or you have additional evidence
                                      that was not presented during your first
                                      interview before reapplying. The academic
                                      institution you choose to attend (and the
                                      I-20 you present) should be the one that
                                      is best suited to your academic interests
                                      and financial resources.
