                      Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab
                      Emirates. It is famous for its Nouveau Arab architecture.
                      Dubai is the desert city-state on the shores of the
                      beautiful Arabian Gulf, replete with clean, sandy beaches
                      and clear blue green waters. It has an ancient heritage
                      that survives amidst the skyscrapers and highways of a
                      modern, cosmopolitan city. This “Pearl of the Arabian
                      Gulf”, concentrated mainly on its exquisite creek, the
                      finest natural shelter in 1600km (1000 miles) of
                      coastline, ranks as the UAEs most important port and
                      commercial Centre. Apart from its exquisite architecture
                      and culture, the education is noteworthy. Study in Dubai
                      for Indian students presents them with immense opportunity
                      to harness their culture.
