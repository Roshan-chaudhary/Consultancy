                      publications.

                    <p>
                      Sandwich programs are made up of a combination of periods
                      of study and time spent in industry. So the course
                      duration extends to 4 years insteadof the usual 3 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Foundation programs are of 1 year duration and are
                      generally tailored for students as an alternative route to
                      bridge between one’s own qualification and that which is
                      required for entry for a degree program in a university /
                      college.

                    <p>
                      Students are strongly advised to apply sooner as the
                      application process may take time due to Universities
                      getting an overwhelming number of applications.

                    <p>
                      Nepalese students must apply for a student visa to study a
                      full-time degree course in the UK. Student visas are not
                      issued for part-time courses. A Student visa is relatively
                      easy to obtain effective from 30th March 2009. The process
                      is further simplified by introducing PBS (Point Based
                      System) called a Tier 4 Student Visa wherein you need to
                      achieve 40 points to make you eligible to get the Student
                      Visa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In addition to our academic counselors at HWHEC, we also
                      have dedicated visa counselors, who are trained in visa
                      formalities to help students to get the required points.
                      It is imperative to have a CAS certificate to be issued by
                      licensed sponsor in prescribed format to get 30 points and
                      10 points for maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Normal length of visa will be full length of the course
                      plus 1 to 4 months depending upon the length of the
                      program.

                      The most apparent cost advantage of studying in the UK is

                      and only 1 year for Masters degree. This means lesser

                      UK universities are generally government funded which
                      mostly means limited funds available for the university to
                      disburse among
                      <br />
                      students as bursaries and scholarships. Still most
                      universities do have certain awards which are given to
                      students based on their merits as well as performance
                      during the course.

                      departments may offer to students coming there to pursue
                      their further studies. Another important source of
                      scholarship are the British Government sponsored awards
                      like the Chevening Scholarship Commonwealth Scholarship,

                                      steeply expensive. However one must keep
                                      the possible returns in mind which are in

                                      considerable time periods which may enable
                                      a larger section of students to go and
                                      study abroad. They will ask for a
                                      collateral security to be pledged. For
                                      higher amount you can even consider the
                                      possibility of an international bank loan.

                                      Some universities require the students to
                                      pay part of the tuition fees in advance in
                                      order to reserve a place for them in the
                                      university. In any case we recommend that
                                      all students should make a deposit payment
                                      as it facilitates in getting a student
                                      visa.
